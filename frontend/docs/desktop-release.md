# Desktop release architecture

Canonical desktop releases are conducted from the private
`Untrivial-ai/ao-releases` repository. That conductor is the only system allowed
to publish stable, nightly, or preview releases. The public
`Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator` repository supplies source and unsigned build
artifacts; it does not hold signing credentials or publish canonical releases.

Do not create release tags or try to publish from this repository. Operators
start and monitor releases in the private conductor, whose runbook contains the
authorized commands and recovery procedures.

## Release flow

At a high level, the conductor:

1. selects a public source commit and records its full SHA and release version;
2. dispatches `.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml` in this repository with
   that pinned SHA and version;
3. downloads the resulting unsigned, short-lived workflow artifacts and
   `digests.json`, then verifies every artifact against the recorded digest;
4. performs signing, macOS notarization, packaging, and updater-feed generation
   in the private release repository;
5. uploads the complete release as a draft;
6. runs remote verification against the draft artifacts and feeds;
7. publishes the verified release atomically; and
8. updates Homebrew where the channel requires it.

Publication does not proceed when a digest, signature, notarization result,
feed, artifact set, or remote verification check differs from what the
conductor expects. A failed run is resumed or replaced from the conductor; it
is never bypassed by publishing directly from this repository.

## Public unsigned build boundary

`.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml` remains intentionally dispatchable. It
accepts an explicit public ref/SHA and version, builds the four supported
desktop targets, and uploads unsigned workflow artifacts plus their SHA-256
digests. It has read-only repository permissions, does not use release signing
secrets, and does not create, edit, or publish GitHub Releases.

The private conductor pins the immutable source SHA before dispatch and treats
the returned digests as the handoff boundary. Signing credentials and release
publication permissions stay in `Untrivial-ai/ao-releases`.

## Channels

- **Stable** releases are deliberate production cuts. After all verification
  gates pass, publication updates the stable updater feeds and the Homebrew
  distribution metadata.
- **Nightly** releases are conductor-scheduled builds from the configured public
  source line. They remain prereleases and update only nightly feeds.
- **Preview** releases are conductor-requested builds for an isolated candidate
  or change. They remain prereleases on their own preview channel and cannot
  replace stable or nightly feeds.

Version selection, channel naming, retention, and promotion policy belong to
the conductor. `frontend/package.json` may be stamped during an unsigned build,
but changing it in this repository is not a release trigger.

## Packaged runtime compatibility

macOS and Linux packages build and ship a pinned tmux under
`resources/tmux/bin/tmux`. Before spawning the daemon, Electron atomically
stages that binary in versioned storage under the AO data directory; this keeps
it available after a Linux AppImage mount disappears. The daemon derives an
explicit AO-private `tmux -S` socket from its run-file identity and starts tmux
without reading the user's tmux configuration. New sessions never leave that
socket.

For updates or downgrades involving older handles, the daemon scans the
historical named `-L ao`, system-default, and private sockets. It routes an
existing session only when its immutable pane command proves the same AO
run-file, session id, supervised marker, and launch generation, then persists a
namespace-qualified handle and repairs stale lifecycle facts. Multiple owned
matches require explicit recovery; a same-named user session is never adopted.
Older adapters reject qualified handles instead of treating them as bare tmux
names, which makes later downgrades fail closed.

Socket inodes remain in AO state. A bounded owner-only `/tmp` directory alias
handles deeply nested paths on macOS, and unsafe shared-writable socket
directories fail closed. Pane environments are applied over stdin before the
real command starts, keeping configured values out of process arguments.
Windows uses ConPTY and carries no tmux resource.

## Artifact verification

The conductor owns the authoritative verification and publication gates. For a
local diagnosis of a downloaded macOS artifact, use the repository's supported
verification script:

```bash
frontend/scripts/verify-mac-artifact.sh <artifact>
```

The script preserves the archive's code-signing metadata while extracting and
runs the expected signature, Gatekeeper, and notarization checks. Do not use a
plain `unzip` result to judge a macOS signature.

Stable macOS releases continue to include both a DMG for first installation and
a ZIP for electron-updater. The ZIP and `latest-mac.yml` must remain available:
electron-updater cannot install an update from a DMG. Nightly and preview
channels omit the first-install DMG.

## Incident rule

Exactly one publisher is a correctness requirement. If the conductor is
unavailable or a release is partially staged, stop and recover through the
private runbook. Do not dispatch a public publishing workflow, create a
substitute release, mutate an existing release, or publish from a second
identity.
