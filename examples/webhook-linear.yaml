          CI failed. FIRST: add the "ci-failed" label to your Linear issue.
          Then follow this checklist:
          1. Read the full CI log output
          2. Identify every failing test and build error
          3. Fix each failure — do NOT skip or disable tests
          4. Run the build locally: pnpm build
          5. Run tests locally: pnpm test
          6. If both pass, push. If not, repeat from step 2.
          7. AFTER CI passes: remove the "ci-failed" label from the Linear issue.
