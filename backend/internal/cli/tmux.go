// ensureTmux satisfies the tmux runtime prerequisite before the desktop app is
// launched, instead of letting the user discover it as an opaque
// RUNTIME_PREREQUISITE_MISSING error on their first spawn. On an interactive
// terminal it offers to run the platform package manager for them; otherwise it
// prints the exact command to run by hand.
//
// This is the CLI complement to the daemon's install surface, not a duplicate
// of it. Both resolve the argv through systeminstall.Resolve, but on Linux
// every package manager needs root, and the daemon runs inside the desktop app
// with no terminal to prompt on, so it can only ever print the command. Here
// there is a real tty, so sudo can actually ask for a password and the install
// completes. This is the only place a Linux install can genuinely happen.
//
// It never blocks `ao start`. Back when ensureTmux() ran in the CLI, `ao start`
// WAS the daemon, so no tmux meant nothing could work. It is now only the
// desktop-app launcher, and the app is still usable without a session runtime,
// so an unmet prerequisite is a warning here and remains a hard error at spawn.
